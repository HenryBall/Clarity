# Clarity
<center>We've developed an iOS application that allows users to be more responsible for their individual water footprint through the food they eat. Using text matching and text recognition, users are able to input the food they eat throughout the day and retrieve the water footprint of each food. We hope that providing the water footprint will encourage users to consider the impact of the foods they eat and ultimately build a diet with a smaller impact.  </center>

## Why did we build this?
Did you know that only 3% of Earth's water is fresh water? Or that only 1% is available for drinking? <br>
<br>
While we are told to shorten our showers and turn off the faucets while brushing our teeth, the food we eat is actually the largest source of water consumption.
<br> <br>
<b> A whopping 80% of water consumption in the U.S. is dedicated to agriculture.  </b>
<br> <br>
So, how do we make a more meaningful effort toward water sustainability? We need to look at the food we eat!
<br>
To make this data easy and accessible, we've developed Clarity. By allowing users to keep track of their personal water footprint, we hope to encourage users to make changes toward a more sustainable diet.

## How it works

 </p>
 
When the user opens the app, they are presented with a screen that allows them to see multiple points of data at once
* The percent of their daily limit they have eaten so far
* How many gallons left until their daily limit
* Their average daily limit
* Two most recent items entered <br> 

Scrolling on the daily limit section reveals a breakdown of the user's water usage per meal. This allows users to see which meals are particularly water consumptive and focus on making changes there first.

 </p>
 
When the user selects a specific meal, they are able to see both the total water usage for that meal and the water footprint of each ingredient. Selecting an item brings up the details page which provides 4 main points of data: <br>
* An overall rating for the item (good/fair/bad)
* How this item compares to other items in the same category
* Serving size this water footprint value is based on
* Source URL where the data was extracted from

 </p>
To encourage the user to improve their water footprint, they are able to set a daily limit. This value is used to calculate the value shown on the home screen.
