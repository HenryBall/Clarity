# Clarity
<center>Simply put, it's an iOS application that allows users to be more responsible for their individual water footprint through the food they eat. Using text matching and text recognition, users are able to input the food they eat throughout the day and retrieve the water footprint of each food. </center>

## Why did we build this?
Did you know that only 3% of Earth's water is fresh water? Or that only 1% is available for drinking? <br>
<br>
While we are told to shorten our showers and turn off the faucets while brushing our teeth, the food we eat is actually the largest source of water consumption.
<br> <br>
<b> A whopping 80% of water consumption in the U.S. is dedicated to agriculture.  </b>
<br> <br>
So, how do we make a more meaningful effort toward water sustainability? We need to look at the food we eat!
<br>
To make this data easy and accessible, we've developed Clarity. By allowing users to keep track of their personal water footprint, we hope to encourage a more sustainable diet.
