Did you know that only 3% of Earth's water is fresh water? Or that only 1% is available for drinking?
While we are told to shorten our showers and turn off the faucets while brushing our teeth, the food we eat is actually the largest source of water consumption.

A whopping 80% of water consumption in the U.S. is dedicated to agriculture. 

So, how do we make a more meaningful effort toward water sustainability? We need to look at the food we eat!

To make this data easy and accessible, we've developed Clarity, an iOS application designed to help you track the water footprint of the food you eat.
